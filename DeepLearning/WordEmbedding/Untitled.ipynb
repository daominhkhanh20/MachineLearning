    "\n",
    "- A word embedding is an approach to provide a dense vector representation of word that capture something about their meaning\n",
    "- Word embedding are an improvement over simple bag-of-word model word encoding schemes like word counts and frequencies that result in large and sparse vectors(mostly 0 values) that describe documents but not the meaning of words\n",
    "- Word embedding work by using an algorithms to train set of fixed-length dense and continuous-valued vectors based on a large corpus text. Each word is represented by a point in the embedding space and these points are learned and moved around based on the words that surround the target word\n",
    "- It is defining a word by the company that it keeps that allows the word embedding to learn something about the meaning of words. The vector space representation of words provide a projection where words with similar meaning are locally clustered within the space"
